# Data-exploration-project
In this project I aimed to explore the world_layoffs dataset which I created a stagging table to protect the original data(layoffs_stagging2) and highlight a few key trends and insights I picked up from this datasets. I used mysql for this project. Key sql techniques I used include :  windows functions like dense_rank,aggregation functions(max,avg) ,data transformation(substring and year functions).I also used CTES, this was my favourite part of the project. I used ctes in 2 instances one of the instances was to rank the businesses which laid off the most workers. Check out my sql which I uploaded for the code and I also left comments to make it easier for people going through my code to understand my logic and my though processes.
